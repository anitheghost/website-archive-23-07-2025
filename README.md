# Student File Sharing Portal

A simple **file sharing portal** aimed at helping students share assignments, notes, and important documents directly from a single platform.

## Motivation

I built this project because I was tired of repeatedly sending notes and other important documents to my fellow students, especially as exams approached. This portal provides a **centralized platform** to upload and share files efficiently with classmates.
